I started my career and specialized in Web development using React.js, developed projects together using Next.js and improved my skills in JavaScript and TypeScript.

The goal has always been to specialize in the world of mobile development, currently I dedicate my time specifically to React Native, working daily with the consumption of REST APIs, using the versioning system and agile methodologies, creating and improving mobile application designs using Figma, Realizo publishing mobile applications in the Google Play and App Store stores, carrying out control through the Google Play Console and App Connect panels and finally playing the role of Scrum Master in mobile projects.

In 2023 I had the opportunity to give my first lecture and I spoke about the evolution of smartphones, mobile development and the job market for primary and secondary school students.

Currently the focus is on developing using React Native, but previously I had the opportunity to develop using PHP, Laravel with Blade, Slim with Twig, I used Docker servers and I even implemented Spotify Backstage for project and team management.

This is a brief summary of some activities and specializations that I had the opportunity to have contact with, always taking into account the idea that evolution is constant and studies cannot stop.
